## Steps to Completion

Choose a either level 1, level 2, or level 3 to complete based on your prior experience with 3D tools. If you are a novice, choose Level 1. If you have some experience, choose Level 2. If you are very experienced with 3D tools, choose Level 3.

[Level 1 and 2 Steps](#level-1) | [Level 2 and 3 Steps](#level-2-3)

### <a name="level-1"></a>Level 1:

1. Model an animal using a polygonal modeling workflow (not a human).
2. Follow the relevant tutorials.
3. Choose a style and experiment with shaders, materials, and freestyle lines.
4. Save a 1920x1080 render as **_render-{{ page.submission-id }}.png_** in the project folder.
6. Save your file as **_{{ page.submission-id }}_.blend** in the project folder.
7. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_{{ page.submission-id }}.zip._**
8. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
9. Ensure you’ve included everything properly. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded the file will result in your exercise being graded according the grading criteria.

### <a name="level-2-3"></a>Level 2 and 3:

1. Model a polygonal character in the [T pose](https://www.animatorisland.com/the-t-pose-all-about-the-mighty-blueprint/?v=7516fd43adaa). The character should be a "zombie apocalypse survivor." 
2. Follow the level three tutorials.
3. Create shaders, materials, and freestyle lines to the level of detail shown in the tutorial.
4. Save a 1920x1080 render as **_render-{{ page.submission-id }}.png_** in the project folder.
6. Save your file as **_{{ page.submission-id }}-L3_.blend** in the project folder.
7. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_{{ page.submission-id }}-L3.zip._**
8. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
9. Ensure you’ve included everything properly. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded the file will result in your exercise being graded according the grading criteria.

**Example _Level 3_ folder structure**

```

{{ page.submission-id }}-L3.zip
