>"a shift from designing for how the world is ... to designing for how the world could be"
>
> —Dunne and Raby, "Speculative Everything"

For this project, you will model, texture, light, and render a set of **three related images** and critically reflect on your work in a 150 word **work statement**. These images do not have to be of the same object(s), but they must have some common conceptual thread that ties them together as a body of work. You will _develop a concept_ by first considering a **subject** like an environment, structure, object, or experience that you find interesting or problematic. Experiment with unexpected materials, proportions, scales, alerations, and additions or subtractions. Aesthetics are not only concerned with the way that things look, but also the underlying principles used to establish meaning, emotion, and senstation.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, the application of [formal design principles](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf), competent rendering technique, good [composition](https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-Elements-tutorials/essentials-composition/633865/676339-4.html?org=psu.edu)practices, and will require the you lead to discussion about the kind of reality needed to make these objects possible and the importance of pursuing or not pursuing such realities.

## Production Methods
You will go through a variety of different project phases including:

  1. Identify an object or issue that interests you;
  2. Develop concpet through brainstorming, sketching, and research;
  3. Produce models, texture maps, and surface shaders;
  4. Create lighting and cameras;
  6. Configure render settings and experiement for high quality results;
  7. Get feedback and improve your work;
  8. Write work statement.

## Constraints
- Use 3D tools to produce images
- **Three** separately rendered images
- All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset.


## Deliverables
All deliverables will be uploaded to the linked dropboxes.
