For this project, you will create a **speculative design fiction** that will take the form of a poster. You will design, model, texture, and render a set of **three related images** and critically reflect on your work in a 150 word **work statement**. In addition to the images and work statement, you will places these images on a **24" by 36" poster** (PDF, printing optional) with descriptive text where necessary. The goal of this project is to communicate and explain your ideas in the format of an art poster.

You will develop your concept around some environment, structure, object, or experience that you find interesting or problematic, and re-imagine it as a fictional version set in the future. You will imagine it's purpose and how it differs from examples of current day. This fiction can be naturally occurring, manufactured, synthetic, biological, or a mix. Experiment with unexpected colors, materials, proportions, scales, and textures.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, the application of [formal design principles](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf), competent rendering technique, good [composition](https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-Elements-tutorials/essentials-composition/633865/676339-4.html?org=psu.edu)practices, and will require the you lead to discussion about the kind of reality needed to make these objects possible and the importance of pursuing or not pursuing such realities.

## Production Methods
You will go through a variety of different project phases including:

  1. Identify an object or issue that interests you;
  2. Develop concpet through brainstorming, sketching, and research;
  3. Produce models, texture maps, and surface shaders;
  4. Create lighting and cameras;
  6. Configure render settings and experiement for high quality results;
  7. Get feedback and improve your work;
  8. Create a poster layout, color grade images, and place copy (text);
  9. Write work statement.

## Constraints
- Use 3D tools to produce images
- **Three** separately rendered images
- All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset.
- Images be combined on a 24"wide x 36"tall poster format.
